        <p>Since I started owning crypto-currencies, I&rsquo;ve had a harder and harder time keeping track of my finances. With my modest fortune spread between multiple bank accounts, ether and bitcoin addresses, I needed a better way to know my total net worth and how each of my assets was performing. I decided to use Airtable and it&rsquo;s extensive API to build a single place where I could do just that. In this post I will show you how you too can use Airtable and a simple web server to keep track of your finances.</p>

        <p>Introduction Welcome to the wonderful world of programming. In this intro guide, I want to help you get up to speed with some of the fundamentals of what &lsquo;programming&rsquo; actually means and how you can get started with learning this very powerful tool. Computers can empower you to build systems that work while you sleep, send information around the globe in milliseconds and calculate really complex equations in the blink of an eye.</p>

        <p><p>I&rsquo;ve been playing around with <a href="ttps://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> recently and have decided to use it in the deployment of a Golang Negroni + Postgres webapp I&rsquo;ve been working on. In order to ensure future scalability and to comply with best practices, this meant spinning up two docker containers, one for the app and another for the database and linking the two. Working with docker for the first time, there were quite a few gotchas involved so I wanted to share with you a comprehensive walkthrough.</p>

They have an extensive API that allows 3rd party developers to build apps on top of their platform. I noticed they didn&rsquo;t have an API wrapper written in Go, so I decided to write one. In this post, I will show you how to write a simple app using both their API Key and OAuth methods of authentication.</p>

        <p><p>About a year ago I was watching South Park and realized how hilarious the show was despite the simplicity of the animations. I then started to think about how many more funny stories could be told if anyone could make an animation, not just the handful of people at South Park Studios. I decided to find out and began building Dubbit, an animated cartoon creator app together with Soroush Pour. After we threw in a month or two of work, it was starting to come together and we launched a minimally viable product with a bare bones feature set to the Apple app store and the cartoons started pouring in from all around the world!</p>

        <p><p>I recently was dealing with a JSON object returned from an external API. I wanted to decode the JSON object into Golang structs so that I could then process and store its contents in my application. Go has a nifty <a href="http://golang.org/pkg/encoding/json/">JSON Package</a> that makes this process very easy by using the Unmarshal function that takes both the JSON and a pointer to a holder struct into which it is to be decoded.</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">err := json.Unmarshal(b, &amp;m)  // b must contain valid JSON that fits into m
</code></pre>

<p>This is very straightforward when dealing with JSON objects that contain objects or array of objects. But what if the API returns an array of arrays? In this case, you will need to unmarshal the JSON into a struct containing an array of arrays of either a specific type (i.e string) or an empty interface (i.e interface{}). As an example, if the API returns the following JSON:</p>

        <p><p>For the past month I have been spending lots of my time researching cryptocurrencies, most notably Bitcoin and Stellar. After having read multiple whitepapers, manually generating and executing bitcoin transactions on the blockchain and speaking with many of the thought leaders in the space including: <a href="http://www.coinbase.com/about">Fred Ehrsam</a>, <a href="https://www.stellar.org/about/">Joyce Kim</a> and <a href="http://gendal.wordpress.com/about/">Richard Gendal Brown</a>, I am more convinced then ever before that cryptocurrencies are here to stay and will revolutionize the way our world works. In this post, I want to share with you two of the fundamental realizations that have lead me to this conclusion and also some hurdles that are already slowing down the expansion of cryptocurrencies.</p>

        <p><p>In august 2012, Soroush and I returned to school after having worked on WealthLift.com full-time for a year. One of our mentors told us to write down all the lessons we had learned from working on WealthLift. I am very thankful that I took the time to do it, and this is what I wrote. It&rsquo;s not the most organised brain dump, but there are some real gems in here that have now become part of my DNA as a founder.</p>

<p>You will have arguments and bickering. It&rsquo;s really important that you both completely respect one another. Respect each other to tell the truth, even when its  unpleasant, and also enough to judge and weigh each others ideas and arguments with an even hand.</p>

<p>After discovering upon Gael&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.inmoov.fr/" title="InMoov Project">InMoov Project</a>, I decided to start building the InMoov Humanoid Robot. It&rsquo;s been an extremely great learning experience and by far the largest hardware project I have ever undertaken. There were so many lessons learned from this project and so I wanted to share them here with you. Below is a video of the arm Soroush, Alex, Doug and I were able to build within 2 months.</p>

<p>Until this point in time, the development of humanoid robotics has taken place in the R&amp;D centers of large organizations. The reason for this has been the extraordinary cost of the hardware, software and collaboration tools at their disposal. Let&rsquo;s face it, a humanoid robot is an incredibly complex piece of engineering. Every joint, every muscle, not to mention the myriad of cognitive functions that are to be reproduced in a semi-intelligible robot are overwhelming. In order to tackle this challenge, I believe the only way to successfully do so is to tap into the ingenuity of the masses, to enable mass collaboration like that which has never before been possible.</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="/imgs/inmoov.png" style="width: 500px; height: 335px;"/>
</p>

<p>We are about to enter into an era of unprecedented collaboration. The open source movement which began in the obscure corners of the internet, on IRC channels and email-lists is getting exponentially better at enabling people to find interesting projects, contribute with minimal additional effort and most importantly, is no longer limited to software.</p>
